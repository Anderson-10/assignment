			<h1>Welcome to my site! Come in and stay a while</h1>
			<!-- The element in the paragrah represent a block of text -->
			<p>New Year has always been my favorite holiday. 5 years ago I have started desigining and hand-making 
			different New Year products. My adventure that started as making New Year gifts for friends 
			took a turn this year, when I started selling some of my favourite products. They turned out to be quite a hit, and so I have
			started this website.<br></p>		
			<p>If you click on the About me link, you can browse my favorite New Year pictures, stories, and movies. 
			And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things New Year.</p>
